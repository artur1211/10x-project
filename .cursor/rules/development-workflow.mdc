# Development Workflow

## Development Environment

### Local Development

The application runs at `http://localhost:3000` during development.

## Code Verification Workflow

After making changes, verify the code using these commands in sequence:

```bash
npm run build
npx tsc
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```

This ensures:
1. The build completes successfully
2. TypeScript types are valid
3. Linting errors are fixed
4. Code is properly formatted

## Development Best Practices

- Use `npm run dev` for local development with hot reload
- Run `npm run test:watch` in parallel during TDD
- Always verify changes with the verification workflow before committing
- Use `npm run test:e2e` to validate end-to-end flows
- Check coverage with `npm run test:coverage` to ensure adequate test coverage
